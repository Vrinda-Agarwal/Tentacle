# Tentacle Development: Next Steps

Based on our comprehensive development plan, here are the recommended next steps for transforming Tentacle into a GitKraken-like TUI application.

## Immediate Actions

1. **Set up development environment**
   - Ensure all developers have Python 3.12+ installed
   - Use UV for environment management and dependency installation
   - Install dependencies with `uv pip install -e .`
   - Familiarize team with Textual framework documentation

2. **Create feature branches for parallel development**
   - Component 1 & 4: Git repository integration and file tree enhancement
   - These can be developed in parallel as they have no dependencies

## Component Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Components 1 & 4)
- **Component 1: Git Repository Integration** - Foundation for all Git operations
- **Component 4: Git Status File Tree Enhancement** - Enhanced UI navigation

These components can be implemented in parallel by different team members.

### Phase 2: Core Diff Functionality (Component 2)
- **Component 2: Hunk-based Diff Processing** - Essential for GitKraken-like staging

### Phase 3: Staging Operations (Component 3)
- **Component 3: Hunk Staging Controls** - Primary user interaction component

### Phase 4: Git Operations (Components 5 & 6)
- **Component 5: Commit Functionality** - Core Git workflow
- **Component 6: Branch Management** - Version control management

These can be developed in parallel after the diff processing is complete.

### Phase 5: UI Polish and Configuration (Components 7 & 8)
- **Component 7: Status Bar Enhancement** - Improved user feedback
- **Component 8: Configuration and Preferences** - Customization and persistence

These components can also be implemented in parallel.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Quality**
   - Follow YAGNI, SRP, and DRY principles
   - Keep files under 600 lines
   - Use type hints for all functions and variables

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for Git operations
   - UI tests for interactive elements

3. **Integration Process**
   - Each component should be independently testable
   - Components should have well-defined interfaces
   - Use pull requests for code review and integration

4. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Log important operations and failures
   - Implement error handling for Git operations
   - Track performance metrics for diff processing

## Success Metrics Tracking

1. User feedback sessions after each phase
2. Performance benchmarks for diff processing
3. Error rate tracking for Git operations
4. UI responsiveness measurements

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Git Repository Corruption**
   - Always implement dry-run options for destructive operations
   - Use GitPython's index properly to avoid direct file manipulation

2. **UI Performance Issues**
   - Test with large repositories regularly
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large file lists

3. **Configuration Failures**
   - Default to safe configuration values
   - Implement graceful degradation when config fails

## Additional Feature Ideas

After completing the core plan, consider these enhancements:

1. Individual line staging within hunks
2. Commit history visualization
3. Remote repository operations (push/pull)
4. File search functionality
5. Git blame visualization

These should be planned as separate components following the same principles.
